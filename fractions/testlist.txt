1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4
1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5 (same denominator)
1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 (simplify)
2/3 + 5/9 =  11/9 (improper fraction)
3 + 1/3 = 10/3 (whole number + fraction)
-1/3 + -3/4 = -13/12 (negatives)
2 + 3 = 5 (whole numbers)
-4 + 3 = 11 (negative integers)
3 + 0 = 0 (simple)
0 + 0 = 0 (simpler)
1/5 + 1/3 + 2/5 = 14/15 (more than two)
1/0 + 2/3 = error!
1/-4 + -3/-4 = 1/2  (complex... reducing, neg denom)
